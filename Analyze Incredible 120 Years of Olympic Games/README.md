### Incredible 120 Years of Olympic Games
Introduction

The modern Olympics represents an evolution of all games from 1986 to 2016. Because the Olympics is an international sports event. It is affected by global issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and world wars. Nevertheless, there are positive movements such as women's empowerment and the development of the game itself.

In this project, I used a 120-year-old dataset containing a massive collection of data. I downloaded the data from Kaggle Website. Link[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results]
First and foremost, I wanted to study the dataset to get answers to the following questions: How many columns are in the dataset? How many datasets are there?
